## Abstract

This book explores how intelligence and cyber-security analysts can uncover hidden links between threat actor infrastructure and ongoing investigations by pivoting on both classic and unconventional indicators — many of which are often overlooked. The material is grounded in empirical, field-tested strategies used i
n cyber-security, digital forensics, cyber threat intelligence, and intelligence analysis more broadly.

Our goal is to provide analysts with a practical toolkit of analytical methods, supported by real-world examples, to enhance investigative workflows without locking them into a single mindset, strict model, or overly rigid technical strategy. Instead, the book encourages creative exploration, data-driven reasoning, 
and the use of diverse data points — from traditional IOCs to subtle metadata traces — as part of a flexible and repeatable analytical process.

The approach presented throughout this book is intentionally built upon open-source tooling, most notably the MISP threat intelligence platform and the AIL Project. By relying on transparent and widely adopted tools, every technique described here can be reproduced, validated, and reused by analysts, researchers, ed
ucators, or incident response teams. This ensures that the methodology is not theoretical or proprietary, but openly verifiable, community-driven, and designed to evolve. The book itself follows the same philosophy: it is an open, living document, publicly versioned, and contributions are [welcomed directly via Git](https://github.com/adulau/the-art-of-pivoting). Readers are encouraged to experiment, improve, and extend the content, making the entire workflow repeatable, auditable, and collaborative within the wider defensive security community.
